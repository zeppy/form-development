form-development
================

<p>This was a personal project that I decided to complete to test myself and to showcase my abilities.</p>

<p>I was inspired by Matt D. Smith (http://mattdsmith.com/) after reading his article 
http://mattdsmith.com/float-label-pattern/. The article shares his solution for forms on mobile devices
that save space, are aesthetically pleasing but don't forego usability.</p>

<p>Matts solution was to use to use placeholders to label the inputs and then upon typing in an input 
the label would appear above the input field so that the user still knew what it was.</p>
